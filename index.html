                <h2>What is e-waste?</h2>
                <p>
                    E-waste is electrical and electronic equipment of any kind that has been discarded. It includes practically anything powered by an electrical source (e.g., from a power socket or a battery). Common types of e-waste include the following:
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Infocomm technology
                    (ICT) equipment</span>, such as desktop, laptop and tablet computers, mobile phones, computer and mobile phone batteries, printers, peripherals and accessories such as keyboards, modems, monitors, computer mice, docking stations, hard
                    disk drives, battery chargers, etc. </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold"> Home appliances </span>, such as TVs, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, rice cookers, microwave and toaster ovens, electric kettles, food processors and blenders, electric fans, DVD/video/music
                    players, radios, hi-fis, vacuum cleaners, etc. Other types of e-waste include lamps and lighting devices, batteries, electronic toys, sports and leisure equipment, etc. </p>
                <p>E-waste is mostly made up of metal and plastic components, but also contains small amounts of heavy metals and substances of concern (e.g., in printed circuit boards). The wide variety of e-waste makes it hard to generalise the material
                    content – for example, fridges and air conditioners in particular contain refrigerants to enable cooling to take place, but these refrigerants may also contribute to ozone layer depletion or climate change; the material composition
                    of a mobile phone is very different from that of an electric kettle.
                </p>
                <h2>Why should I recycle my e-waste?</h2>
                <p>
                    Recycling e-waste protects human and environmental health. Improper disposal of e-waste leads to environmental pollution and this may in turn harm human health. The best way to treat e-waste is to recycle it properly. E-waste comprises many different
                    components and requires specialised equipment to dismantle, shred, process and extract the constituent materials that can then be turned into new products. This has to be performed within a controlled system to prevent pollution and
                    ensure workplace safety and health. Recycling e-waste helps to conserve our earth’s precious natural resources. Recycled material is used to make new products. This reduces the need to mine limited raw materials from the earth. Reducing
                    the need for mining also lowers pollution, as the process of mining has an impact on our environment.

                    <p>
                        We can see that waste output in Singapore continues to grow steadily almost every year. Singapore has only one landfill, and thus landfilling is not the solution to directly deal with our trash. As a result, we can see that almost half of our trash are being incinerated, and then having the by-products (ash and sludge) landfilled instead to conserve space. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Incinerating trash consumes a lot of energy, money and land space. It also results in harmful pollutants being released into the direct environment we live in which can then have harmful effects to our health. While Singapore does its best to treat the flue gas from incineration, even the best systems are unable to remove 100% of the pollutants produced. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From the above diagrams, you might think that Singapore is doing a fantastic job recycling over half of its total waste. You will also notice recycling rates increasing year on year along with total trash output. If you went through each year's waste management distribution, year 2015 shows close to 60% of waste being recycled compared to around 50% in year 2000. In year 2004, recycling overtook incineration as the main method we manage our total waste output. So does this mean that our waste sorting system and recycling facilities are getting really good? That is unfortunately not true... 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the next page, we will see that there are improvements in recycling some of the ashes from our incineration processes instead of landfilling it. But you will also notice that having strong total recycling rates do not tell us much at all. We will need to break down recycling rates to the material type to take a closer look into Singapore's waste management efficacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will see why recycling is NOT the way to go and we need to change the way that us, as consumers, think about trash.

                    While the concept of recycling is encouraged by government bodies and is believed by most that they are doing their part to be environmentally-friendly, it is clear that it is <b>NOT</b> sustainable at all. We cannot continue living
                        in a bubble of ignorance and living guilt-free from our environmental impacts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our recycling practices of consumables and their packagings not being effective, we need to <b>REMOVE</b> the "Recycle" from the three famous R's(Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) from consumer behaviors immediately. By focusing on only <span style="font-size:1.3em">reducing </span>and
                    <span
                        style="font-size:1.3em"> reusing</span>, we can drastically help reduce waste as well as encourage businesses and manufacturers to come up with different ways to tackle this issue. We need to make a statement.
                </p>
