                <h2>What is e-waste?</h2>
                <p>
                    E-waste is electrical and electronic equipment of any kind that has been discarded. It includes practically anything powered by an electrical source (e.g., from a power socket or a battery). Common types of e-waste include the following: Infocomm technology
                    (ICT) equipment, such as desktop, laptop and tablet computers, mobile phones, computer and mobile phone batteries, printers, peripherals and accessories such as keyboards, modems, monitors, computer mice, docking stations, hard disk
                    drives, battery chargers, etc. Home appliances, such as TVs, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, rice cookers, microwave and toaster ovens, electric kettles, food processors and blenders, electric fans, DVD/video/music
                    players, radios, hi-fis, vacuum cleaners, etc. Other types of e-waste include lamps and lighting devices, batteries, electronic toys, sports and leisure equipment, etc. E-waste is mostly made up of metal and plastic components, but
                    also contains small amounts of heavy metals and substances of concern (e.g., in printed circuit boards). The wide variety of e-waste makes it hard to generalise the material content – for example, fridges and air conditioners in particular
                    contain refrigerants to enable cooling to take place, but these refrigerants may also contribute to ozone layer depletion or climate change; the material composition of a mobile phone is very different from that of an electric kettle.
                </p>
                <h2>Why should I recycle my e-waste?</h2>
                <p>
                    Recycling e-waste protects human and environmental health. Improper disposal of e-waste leads to environmental pollution and this may in turn harm human health. The best way to treat e-waste is to recycle it properly. E-waste comprises many different
                    components and requires specialised equipment to dismantle, shred, process and extract the constituent materials that can then be turned into new products. This has to be performed within a controlled system to prevent pollution and
                    ensure workplace safety and health. Recycling e-waste helps to conserve our earth’s precious natural resources. Recycled material is used to make new products. This reduces the need to mine limited raw materials from the earth. Reducing
                    the need for mining also lowers pollution, as the process of mining has an impact on our environment.

                        to face very poor recycling rates.</p>
