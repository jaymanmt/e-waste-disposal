# Project Name: Find your nearest e-waste drop-off

# UX: 
- quickly access data on where to responsibly dispose of e-waste,
this data will include maps on the nearest locations within 5kilometres
for convenience.


# Features:

- allow users to select their current location,
- allow users to key in any location, letting them
plan ahead, especially since e-waste can range in various weights
and sizes which will result in vastly different levels of effort to 
organise its transport. The result would be 3 locations closest related to the search
terms and those 3 locations would be compared with the json file to show closest
e-waste disposal. 
- contacts of e-waste disposal also provided to ensure they
do not make a wasted trip. Will recommend to call beforehand before 
heading over. 
1) Existing features: Geolocate appears to work well on chrome browser but faces
issues on safari and firefox. Should not impede on UX too badly if proper if else alerts 
are implemented. 


2) Features left to implement:


# Technologies used:

- jQuery
- mapboxgl
- axios
- bootstrap

Create an ewaste website near you website. 
Followed by simple correlation charts:
1) total waste incinerated, total waste landfill, total waste generated, 
semanku landfill fill estimates - Will be able to draw correlation that we are increasingly 
reliant on incineration for our waste. perhaps able to draw correlation between waste types and 
increases in overall waste.
